When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to collaborate with others on an open source project.
    When you want a separate backup just in case.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because it might erase whatever we are currently working on right now.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork - is purely a GitHub invention. You can only use this on github.
    Clone - can be done locally. Can be done from GitHub if you have permission.
    Branch - can be done in both GitHub and locally. Branches are typically made because someone wants to add a new feature/ do experiments.

    If you want to modify an existing project on GitHub, you will have to fork it unless you have permission, in which you can just clone it by performing a pull request.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    So you can keep track of the changes people make and compare it to yours without needing internet access.

and what would be harder?
